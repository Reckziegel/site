      <title>A consumption function for Brazil</title>

      <description>The Keynesian consumption function is one of the most famous equations in macroeconomics. This post will show how it can be estimated and how can we use a simple trick to add dynamics into the system.
A functional form for \(C_t\)A traditional representation of consumption is
\[ C_t = \alpha + \beta_0 Y^d_t \]
in which, \(C_t\) is consumption at time \(t\), \(Y^d_t\) is the disposable income at \(t\) and \(\beta_0\) is the marginal propensity to consume (MPC).</description>

      <title>The IS-LM Model</title>

      <description>A simple IS-LM model for an open economy can be defined as:
\[ \begin{align}Y &amp;amp;= C(Y, T(Y)) + I(Y, i) + G + X(Y^W, e(i, i^W)) - M(Y, e(i, i^W)) \\M/P &amp;amp;= L(Y, i) \\-K(i, i^W) &amp;amp;= X(Y^W, e(i, i^W)) - M(Y, e(i, i^W)) \\E &amp;amp;= e(i, i^W)\end{align}\] in which \(Y\) is the local GDP; \(C\) is a consumption function that depends on the \(Y\) and \(T\) (taxes); \(I\) is the investment function that depends on \(Y\) and \(i\) (interest-rates).</description>

      <title>The Dance of the Yield</title>

      <description>Studying for the 2019 CFA Level III exam I came across a very interesting chapter on yield curve strategies. The content, among other things, explores the role of convexity and its importance in building custom views for expected returns. The code below intents to visually show that the US yields indeed change in a non-linear fashion very often.
In theory, this can be used to concentrate or spread-out the portfolio maturity holdings.</description>

      <description>The code bellow is a transcription from the MATLAB code done by Ledoit&amp;amp;Wolf for their work Improved estimation of the covariance matrix of stock returns with an application to portfolio selection, which can be found here. If you also want to take a look on the original MATLAB code click here.

      <description>Shrinkage is hardly new in finance. In 1956, Charles Stein published a famous paper called Inadmissibility of the usual estimator for the mean of a multivariate normal distribution. In this work, he shows that, if the sum of the squares of the errors (SSE) is used as a loss function, then, for $ n \geq 2 $, the sample mean is not an optimal estimator and can be improved by exploring the trade-off among bias and variance.</description>

      <description>There has been a huge growth of machine learning models’ in finance. The underlying idea behind those models is that if the data is identically and independent distributed (i.i.d.) the statistician can use the law of large numbers (LLN) and the Glivenko-Canteli theorem to uncover the asymptotic behavior of the “true” distribution, which is, in fact, unknown. As the number of observations increase, closer and closer we get to the true hidden values.</description>

      <title>The Brazilian Debt</title>

      <description>In this post I will show how you can recursively download macroeconomic data covered by the IMF using the Quandl package. To motivate the application, the Brazilian public debt will be used as a variable of interest.
If you are familiar with Quandl you probably heard about the Quandl.search() function. What it does is try to look for a database that matches a specific pattern that you may have interest in, like “oil”, or “GDP”, for example.</description>

      <title>A random walk</title>

      <description>This is my first post. I had planned to add some comments on how I created this blog using the blogdown package, but since I was revisiting a material related to time series I decided that writing about random walks would be a nice start.
1. What is a Random Walk?A random walk could be formally defined as a collection random series that are ordered in time. In a random walk (RW) the realized values of a time series are particular of that specific moment and cannot be extrapolated into the future.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>I decided to create this blog after realizing that most of my notes were easily forgotten somewhere in between my computer and the &amp;ldquo;cloud&amp;rdquo;. This is a space in which I intent to stage my thoughts and share contents related to finance, macroeconomics and econometrics.
As (I hope) you have noticed, my formal training is in economics. Indeed, I&amp;rsquo;m very passionate about it and take part in much of Robert Lucas reasoning:</description>
