      <description>There has been a huge growth of machine learning models’ in finance. The underlying idea behind those models is that a if the data is identically and independent distributed (i.i.d.) the statistician can use the law of large numbers (LLN) and the Glivenko-Canteli theorem to uncover the asymptotic behavior of the “true” distribution, which is, in fact, unknown. As the number of observations increase, closer and closer we get to the true values.</description>

      <title>The Brazilian Debt</title>

      <description>In this post I will show how you can recursively download macroeconomic data covered by the IMF using the Quandl package. To motivate the application, the Brazilian public debt will be used as a variable of interest.
If you are familiar with Quandl you probably heard about the Quandl.search() function. What it does is try to look for database that matches a specific pattern that you may have interest in, like “oil”, or “GDP”, for example.</description>

      <title>A random walk</title>

      <description>This is my first post. I had planned to add some comments on how I created this blog using the blogdown package, but since I was revisiting a material related to time series I decided that writing about random walks would be a nice start.
1. What is a Random Walk?A random walk could be formally defined as a collection random series that are ordered in time. In a random walk (RW) the realized values of a time series are particular of that specific moment and cannot be extrapolated into the future.</description>

      <title>A Plain Markdown Post</title>

      <description>This is a post written in plain Markdown (*.md) instead of R Markdown (*.Rmd). The major differences are:
 You cannot run any R code in a plain Markdown document, whereas in an R Markdown document, you can embed R code chunks (```{r}); A plain Markdown post is rendered through Blackfriday, and an R Markdown document is compiled by rmarkdown and Pandoc.  There are many differences in syntax between Blackfriday&amp;rsquo;s Markdown and Pandoc&amp;rsquo;s Markdown.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m an economist and I hold a master degree in Applied Economics (Econometrics Track). I&amp;rsquo;m also a candidate for the level III CFA exam on jun/2019.
I decided to create this blog after realizing that most of my notes and codes were easily forgotten somewhere in my computer. This is a space in which I intent to stage my thoughts and share content related to finance and econometrics.
