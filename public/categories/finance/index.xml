      <description>Shrinkage is hardly new in finance. In 1956, Charles Stein published a famous paper called Inadmissibility of the usual estimator for the mean of a multivariate normal distribution. He shows that, if the sum of the squares of the errors is used as a loss function, then, for $ n \geq 2 $, the sample mean can be improved by exploring the trade-off among bias and variance. This improvement is due to shrinkage!</description>

      <description>There has been a huge growth of machine learning models’ in finance. The underlying idea behind those models is that a if the data is identically and independent distributed (i.i.d.) the statistician can use the law of large numbers (LLN) and the Glivenko-Canteli theorem to uncover the asymptotic behavior of the “true” distribution, which is, in fact, unknown. As the number of observations increase, closer and closer we get to the true values.</description>
