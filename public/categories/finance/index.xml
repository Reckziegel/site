      <title>The Dance of the Yield</title>

      <description>Studying for the 2019 CFA Level III exam I came across a very interesting chapter on yield curve strategies. The content, among other things, explores the role of convexity and its importance in building custom views for expected returns.
The code below intents to visually show that the US yields indeed change in a non-linear fashion very often.

      <description>The function bellow is a transcription from the MATLAB code done by Ledoit&amp;amp;Wolf in their work: Improved estimation of the covariance matrix of stock returns with an application to portfolio selection, which can be found here.
If you also want to take a look on the original programming source, check the Michaelâ€™s Wolf website.

      <description>Shrinkage is hardly new in finance. In 1956, Charles Stein published a famous paper called Inadmissibility of the usual estimator for the mean of a multivariate normal distribution. In his work, he shows that, if the sum of the squares of the errors (SSE) is used as a loss function, then, for $ n \geq 2 $, the sample mean is not an optimal estimator. It an be improved by exploring the trade-off among bias and variance.</description>

      <description>Machine Learning (ML) models are trendy and gaining popularity in finance. Practitioners noticed that little help can come from asymptotic theory if the researcher is constrained by the number of observations (in which \(n \rightarrow \infty\) do never happens).
The solution offered by a great deal of ML models is a complete twist in econometric tradition. Forget about odd features and ugly names, like autocorrelation, multicollinearity and heteroskedasticity. Just pay attention to the forecasts: are they good or not?</description>
