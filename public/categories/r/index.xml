      <title>Portfolio Analytics in the Tidyverse</title>

      <description>Portfolio Analytics (PA) is a well known library for portfolio optimization in the R community. Written before the tidyverse gain pulse, the PA package is often used in the “Base R” context. The objective of this post is to show that it can also be use inside the tidyverse (with all the power that comes with it!).
The basic usage of portfolio Analytics can be found here and in it’s four vignettes.</description>

      <title>The Dance of the Yield</title>

      <description>Studying for the 2019 CFA Level III exam I came across a very interesting chapter on yield curve strategies. The content, among other things, explores the role of convexity and its importance in building custom views for expected returns.
The code below intents to visually show that the US yields indeed change in a non-linear fashion very often.

      <description>The function bellow is a transcription from the MATLAB code done by Ledoit&amp;amp;Wolf in their work: Improved estimation of the covariance matrix of stock returns with an application to portfolio selection, which can be found here.
If you also want to take a look on the original programming source, check the Michael’s Wolf website.

      <description>Shrinkage is hardly new in finance. In 1956, Charles Stein published a famous paper called Inadmissibility of the usual estimator for the mean of a multivariate normal distribution. In his work, he shows that, if the sum of the squares of the errors (SSE) is used as a loss function, then, for $ n \geq 2 $, the sample mean is not an optimal estimator. It an be improved by exploring the trade-off among bias and variance.</description>

      <description>Machine Learning (ML) models are trendy and gaining popularity in finance. Practitioners noticed that little help can come from asymptotic theory if the researcher is constrained by the number of observations (in which \(n \rightarrow \infty\) do never happens).
The solution offered by a great deal of ML models is a complete twist in econometric tradition. Forget about odd features and ugly names, like autocorrelation, multicollinearity and heteroskedasticity. Just pay attention to the forecasts: are they good or not?</description>

      <title>The Brazilian Debt</title>

      <description>In this post I will show how you can recursively download macroeconomic data covered by the IMF using the Quandl package. To motivate the application, the Brazilian public debt will be used as a variable of interest.
If you are familiar with Quandl you probably heard about the Quandl.search() function. What it does is try to look for a database that matches a specific pattern that you may have interest in, like “oil”, or “GDP”, for example.</description>
