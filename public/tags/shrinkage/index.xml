      <description>The code bellow is a transcription from the MATLAB code done by Ledoit&amp;amp;Wolf for their work Improved estimation of the covariance matrix of stock returns with an application to portfolio selection, which can be found here. If you also want to take a look on the original MATLAB code click here.

      <description>Shrinkage is hardly new in finance. In 1956, Charles Stein published a famous paper called Inadmissibility of the usual estimator for the mean of a multivariate normal distribution. In this work, he shows that, if the sum of the squares of the errors (SSE) is used as a loss function, then, for $ n \geq 2 $, the sample mean is not an optimal estimator and can be improved by exploring the trade-off among bias and variance.</description>
