      <description>The objective of economic models is to dress common-sense into mathematical formalism1. For some economic models, however, real data is too scare to achieve good statistical analysis. This scarcity of data leads to estimation-error2 (the econometricians enemy number one).
By estimation-error I mean: the researcher is never certain about the true data generating process (DGP) of the phenomenon at hand. As Allan Timmermann and Graham Elliott argue, economic models can be thought as a condense representation of reality, in which mispecifification flourish naturally3.</description>

      <description>The function bellow is a transcription from the MATLAB code done by Ledoit&amp;amp;Wolf in their work: Improved estimation of the covariance matrix of stock returns with an application to portfolio selection, which can be found here.
If you also want to take a look on the original programming source, check the Michaelâ€™s Wolf website.

      <description>Shrinkage is hardly new in finance. In 1956, Charles Stein published a famous paper called Inadmissibility of the usual estimator for the mean of a multivariate normal distribution. In his work, he shows that, if the sum of the squares of the errors (SSE) is used as a loss function, then, for $ n \geq 2 $, the sample mean is not an optimal estimator. It can be improved by exploring the trade-off among bias and variance.</description>
