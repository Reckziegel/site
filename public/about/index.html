    <div class="article-content">
      <p>I decided to create this blog after realizing that most of my notes were easily forgotten somewhere in between my computer and the &ldquo;cloud&rdquo;. This is a space in which I intent to stage my thoughts and share contents related to finance, macroeconomics and econometrics.</p>

<p>As (<em>I hope</em>) you have noticed, my formal training is in economics. Indeed, I&rsquo;m very passionate about it and take part in much of <a href="https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1995/lucas/facts/">Robert Lucas</a> reasoning:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>&ldquo;I do not see how one can look at figures like these without seeing them representing possibilities. Is there some action a government of India could take that would lead the Indian economy to grow like Indonesia&rsquo;s or Egypt&rsquo;s? If so, what exactly? If not, what is it about the &ldquo;nature of India&rdquo; that makes it so? <strong>The consequences for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about anything else</strong>.&rdquo;</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>From my master degree on, I developed a love-hate relationship with Data-Science. The love-part is expressed here mostly by <strong>R</strong> and <strong>Python</strong> programming languages. This website, as an example, was built in <strong>R</strong>. The hate-part, for the grater good, I keep for myself.</p>

<p>The full source code of this page and additional projects I&rsquo;ve involved myself in can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Reckziegel">GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m open to connect.</p>
