I decided to create this blog after realizing that most of my notes were easily forgotten somewhere in between my computer and the "cloud". This is a space in which I intent to stage my thoughts and share contents related to finance, macroeconomics and econometrics. 

As (_I hope_) you have noticed, my formal training is in economics. Indeed, I'm very passionate about it and take part in much of [Robert Lucas](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/1995/lucas/facts/) reasoning: 

> _"I do not see how one can look at figures like these without seeing them representing possibilities. Is there some action a government of India could take that would lead the Indian economy to grow like Indonesia's or Egypt's? If so, what exactly? If not, what is it about the "nature of India" that makes it so? **The consequences for human welfare involved in questions like these are simply staggering: once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think about anything else**."_

From my master degree on, I developed a love-hate relationship with Data-Science. The love-part is expressed here mostly by **R** and **Python** programming languages. This website, as an example, was built in **R**. The hate-part, for the grater good, I keep for myself.

The full source code of this page and additional projects I've involved myself in can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/Reckziegel). 

I'm open to connect.
