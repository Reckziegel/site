I'm an economist and I hold a master degree in Applied Economics (Econometrics Track). I'm also a candidate for the level III CFA exam on jun/2019.

I decided to create this blog after realizing that most of my notes and codes were easily forgotten somewhere in my computer. This is a space in which I intent to stage my thoughts and share content related to finance and econometrics. 

If you would like to see me commenting on a specific subject, please send an email to bernardo_cse@hotmail.com. Job offers can also be sent to the same email.
