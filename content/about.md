I decided to create this blog after realizing that most of my notes and codes were easily forgotten somewhere in my computer. This is a space in which I intent to stage my thoughts and share content related to finance and econometrics. 

My name is Bernardo Reckziegel, I'm an economist and hold a master degree in Applied Economics (Econometrics Track). I'm also another CFA candidate anxious for results to be released in August.
