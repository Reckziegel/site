Studying for the 2019 CFA Level III exam I came across a very interesting chapter on yield curve strategies. The content, among other things, explores the role of convexity and its importance in building custom views for expected returns. 

The code below intents to visually show that the US yields indeed change in a non-linear fashion very often. 

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.align='center', fig.width=12}
# load libraries
library(Quandl)
library(tidyverse)
library(gganimate)
library(ggthemes)

# download the yield from Quandl
us_yields <- Quandl("USTREASURY/YIELD", collapse = "monthly", order = "asc")

# express the maturity holdings in months
maturities <- c("Date", 1/12, 2/12, 3/12, 6/12, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, 30)
n <- nrow(us_yields)

# create the plot
p <- us_yields %>% 
    as_tibble() %>% 
    
    # change maturity names
    `colnames<-`(maturities) %>% 
    
    # tidy
    gather("maturity", "yields", -Date) %>%
    mutate_if(is_character, as.numeric) %>%
    
    # plot 
    ggplot(aes(x = maturity, y = yields, group = Date)) + 
    geom_smooth(level = 0.95, span = 0.75) +
    geom_point(size = 3, alpha = 0.75, color = 'steelblue') + 
    scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 30)) +  
    theme_fivethirtyeight() + 
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    
    # animate
    labs(title    = "US Treasury Yield Curve Dynamics", 
         subtitle = "Constant Maturity Rates Actively Traded at Over-the-Counter: {frame_time}", 
         x        = "Maturity (Years)", 
         y        = "Yields", 
         caption  = "Source: US Treasury & Quandl.com") + 
    transition_time(Date) 

# animate
animate(plot = p, nframes = n,  fps = 5)

```

In a porfolio management context, this convexity can be tought as an "asset". It's main benefit is to twist bond returns: _prices increases_ more than sugested by linear metrics (such as duration) whenever _interest-rates go down_. This feature becomes even more valuable if interest-rates volatility is also expected to increase.  

The main challenge to backtest strategies like [bullets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bulllet.asp) and [barbells](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/barbell.asp) is how to set the correct prior conditional to the fact that time-series information vanishes vary fast. 

I shall come back to this topic in the future.
